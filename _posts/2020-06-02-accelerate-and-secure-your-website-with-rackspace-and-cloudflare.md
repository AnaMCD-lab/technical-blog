For years Rackspace has provided expertise in hosting and securing its customers'
websites. Now in partnership with Cloudflare&reg;, Rackspace can distribute your
website all over the globe, accelerating performance and protecting against DDoS
attacks.

Cloudflare is one of the world's largest networks&mdash;a global content
distribution network (CDN), which sits in front of your website and consists of
reverse proxy servers. Traffic to your website reaches a Cloudflare server first,
on the edge of its massive network. This *Network-Edge-as-a-Service* extends the
reach of your site, bringing it and your Internet properties closer to your site
visitors and therefore making access faster.

Because it processes over 10% of all Internet traffic, Cloudflare can build
real-world intelligence on data transmissions over the Internet and how well
they perform. Rackspace engineers have trained on Cloudflare's features and
configuration to manage its powerful capabilities alongside your Rackspace-hosted
website. Our expertise makes it easy for customers to have an Internet presence
that is secure, performant, and reliable.

### Security

Rackspace has always been an expert at securing your website. And now, with
Cloudflare, you can combat a massively distributed denial-of-service attack with
the power of a massively distributed network! DDoS attacks targeting your website
first hit Cloudflare, which can absorb the attack by using multiple techniques
to block attack traffic and allow legitimate traffic through.

Security policy enforcement no longer needs to be one packet hop in front of your
web server. Rackspace can manage your next-generation firewall rules, which
enforces at the Cloudflare edge, closer to your site visitors and attackers,
before traffic gets even remotely close to your web server.

### Performance

Cloudflare accelerates your website by first having its edge servers close to
your site's visitors and second caching as much of your website's assets there.
With compression techniques and intelligent routing back to your original web
server, Rackspace manages these performance features, reducing latency and
page-load times.

### Reliability

Cloudflare has thousands of edge servers with points of presence spanning 200
cities in more than 95 countries, making sure visitors can reach your website.
The Cloudflare load-balancing capability also allows you to have multiple web
servers spread across global regions to serve as the origin of your website.
Rackspace has expertise and certification in industry-leading load balancing
technologies and can ensure configurations that support highly reliable service
from your site.
