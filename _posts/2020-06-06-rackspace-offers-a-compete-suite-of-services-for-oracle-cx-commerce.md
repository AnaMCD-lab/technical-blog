Rackspace has announced the launch of a complete set of services for Oracle CX
Commerce supporting customers’ digital transformation journey.

<!-- more -->

These services are initially available in the Americas and will be available in
the following regions later this year:

- Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)
- Asia, Pacific, and Japan (APJ).

Oracle&reg; CX Commerce is the latest SaaS-based e-commerce solution from Oracle,
so you do not need hosting to run the application. The Rackspace Applications
(RAS) Digital team has offered solutions for the hosted e-commerce Oracle
Commerce Platform, also known as ATG, since 2013.

### What does the offer include?

Now, we're enhancing the RAS Digital Experience portfolio to include a suite of
offers for customers who want to use Oracle CX Commerce for your e-commerce
application. This suite of offers consists of the following components:

- RAS Digital Experience Implementation Services for Oracle CX Commerce
- RAS Digital Experience Integration Services for Oracle CX Commerce (ProServ offers)
- RAS Digital Experience Application Managed Services for Oracle CX Commerce
  (a monthly subscription offer)

The Rackspace Integration ProServ Team, the RAS Digital Oracle Team, or a trusted
partner do the custom coding and integration work to implement your complete
e-commerce environment on Oracle CX Commerce. This service includes the
development of your custom shopping cart and any integrations between CX Commerce
and other third-party apps needed to provide the complete e-commerce experience.
These offers are statement-of-work based.

RAS Digital Experience Application Management Services (AMS) for Oracle CX
Commerce offers customers who use Oracle CX Commerce for their e-commerce
application a way to obtain ongoing assistance from the RAS Digital Oracle
Commerce team. You can use this support to troubleshoot issues with your Oracle
CX Commerce implementation as well as update your implementation and integrations.
The offering comprises a set block of hours to which you subscribe to for this
work.

Because it offers services for the SaaS version of the Oracle Commerce
Application, RAS AMS for Oracle CX Commerce complements the existing offer of
RAS Digital for ATG.  Customers who choose  Oracle CX Commerce can also purchase
services from Rackspace Oracle Commerce experts to help them get the most value
from their Oracle CX Commerce implementations.

By taking advantage of this offering, your technical experts can focus on other
aspects unique to your business.
