The world has changed dramatically with Covid-19 impacting folks around the
globe, and every business type has felt some impact.

### The impact of Covid-19 on businesses

For example, different businesses with new problems include the following:

- large IT firms have hundreds of new remote workers
- small bakeries need to find an online ordering solution
- legal offices offer their customers remote video appointments
- fast food businesses provide curbside pick-up

Lots of companies have had their entire roadmap changed in the IT world and have
scrambled to find their new normal. As many of us continue our daily lives at
home, we also need to deal with the impact on our IT infrastructure with a never
before seen influx of remote workers.

As an IT administrator, I can tell you these remote workers greatly test our
system stability. However, they also bring the possibility of inadvertent
vulnerabilities, viruses, and possibly even open a direct path into a secured
environment.

We all know that hindsight is always perfectly clear, but that doesn't help those
caught off guard by the pandemic. If your organization was not prepared to handle
the new situation, then you are not alone. Many businesses around the world are
in the same situation and have to find ways to make solutions that work for them.

For example, a small cafe in my area was always busy, but because they only used
standard paper menus, they quickly had to transform into a modern solution.

### Finding or providing solutions

Fortunately, there are many services available that have turn-key solutions for
a web presence, including online ordering, payment processing, and even order
tracking to help customers stay up-to-date on their food status. With many cities
posting stay-at-home orders, it's easier than ever to get a delivery service.
Restaurants no longer worry about hiring drivers. Instead, they use new web tools
to alert and schedule drivers to deliver prepared meals to paying customers while
the food is hot, fresh, and tasty.

To that small cafe, the preceding scenario might sound extraordinarily complex
and virtually impossible to create, especially under these trying circumstances.
Fortunately, there are many choices available to help get those solutions together.
As IT professionals, it is up to us to make the impossible become possible and
support these businesses, many of which we personally frequent, and bring them
into the 2020s.

We need to help these businesses by providing easy to understand and use solutions,
handling all of the backends with systems like Kubernetes&reg; and virtual machines,
and providing amazing customer service. For example, we could design systems that
are resilient enough to handle the rush during peak hours and spin services down
to reduce cost when the business is closed.

Many companies never expected to have full-time remote workers, but due to the
sudden impact of Covid-19, those requirements had to change instantly. How do
you easily move from no remote workers to everyone being a remote worker? How do
you bolster security within your business to keep out unwanted issues like
ransomware? The answers to questions like there are as vast and complex as the
businesses that now require these services. Once again, IT needs to be there to
provide solutions to these businesses.

### The IT industry needs to step up

The IT industry tirelessly provides secured desktops through systems like
VMware&reg; Horizon&reg; and Microsoft&reg; Azure&reg; services so remote workers
to have workstations from which to work.  We also have secured tunneling to those
networks with VPNs, software-defined perimeterâ€Žs, and software-defined networks
that can control every aspect of the ingress and egress within your network.
Solutions like VMware NSX-T or Rackspace Technology hardware VPN solutions allow
business owners to sleep well, knowing their systems are secured from would-be
intruders.

If your business, like countless others, was impacted, you have already started
to examine your situation.  Many companies have never had to consider an IT
department, but the need has suddenly landed in their laps. As a business, you
have to consider the following concerns:

- The extremely high cost of hardware
- Power and cooling requirements
- Securing access to your new IT infrastructure
- The cost of employing multiple IT professionals to support the new equipment
  and services who must:
    - Write code
    - Manage the application and its host OS
    - Configure and maintain secured network environments
    - Configure remote workability
    - Limit access to your new IT infrastructure

### Bottom line

For many businesses, the reality of a new IT department means it quickly becomes
the highest cost center and can even cause operations to close. So how do
companies handle their unique situation? Regardless of your business, there are
solutions out there for you. Solution providers like Rackspace Technology become
a part of your IT department or can even fully supplement them. The Rackspace
Technology data centers, in conjunction with other cloud providers like Google
Cloud Platform&reg; (GCP), Amazon Web Services&reg; (AWS), and Microsoft Azure
(to name but a few) can provide a secured environment to house your solutions.

All of the combined professionals allow your business to rise to the challenge
and thrive during these uncertain times. If your company has a new requirement
for an IT presence, then the global IT industry is here to help. Your business
is not alone in this fight against Covid, and the IT industry wants to partner
with you to make a better technology-driven tomorrow.
