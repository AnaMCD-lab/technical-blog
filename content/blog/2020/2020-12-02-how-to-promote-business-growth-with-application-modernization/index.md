Cloud migration has become a growing norm in business. However, many
businesses that migrate are not maximizing the potential of the cloud. Despite
growing cloud adoption, businesses often fail to operate in a cloud-native manner,
creating inefficiencies in terms of both cost and operations. The problem is that
it can be difficult to define what it means to be *cloud-native*, and gaps in education
keep business leaders from pursuing cloud-native aspirations for business growth and success.

What's clear is that, when optimized properly for business, AWS&reg; offers strong returns of
about 637% over five years, according to the research firm
[IDC](https://pages.awscloud.com/IDC-Fostering-Business-and-Organizational-Transformation-to-Generate-Business-Value-with-AWS.html?trk=ar_card).
These businesses can also expect to see a 51% reduction in the cost of operations, 94% less unplanned
downtime, and an estimated $36.5 million in additional revenue annually. With that in mind, let us
take a moment to clarify what it means to be cloud native, and translate this into the
important considerations for your application migration, including business outcomes.

### Defining the cloud-native mindset

When it comes to defining cloud-native, it's almost easier to describe it in terms of what
cloud-native is not. To be cloud-native does not mean creating a one-to-one equivalent of
your on-premise data center in the cloud. Instead, being cloud-native means analyzing each
workload to assess how it can best operate in the cloud. This means, instead of thinking of
how the application operates on-premise, it is important to look through the lens of running on
the cloud and find the best option for the application. This might mean refactoring or reworking
how the application functions to best leverage the benefits of the cloud.

The reason for this approach is two-fold. First, everyone is adopting the cloud, meaning
when you take a cloud-native approach, you are keeping with the standards and expectations
of your customers and business partners. Thus, operating in this cloud-native manner can help
improve your market positioning. Second, with a cloud native approach, you can improve the efficiency
of your application, allowing for greater scalability and reliability, often at a fraction of the cost.

### Steps to application modernization

Application modernization refers to projects designed to create new business value from existing,
aging applications by updating them with modern features and capabilities. The current trend in
this modernization is migration to the cloud.

There are a number of important considerations after you decide to make your applications cloud-native.

### Understanding your application architecture

First and foremost is understanding your application architecture. This not only means thinking
about which Amazon Web Services&reg; (AWS) services to deploy your application against, but also thinking through how to
manage availability, scalability, performance, and cost. Thankfully, AWS has a set of best practices
and example templates to consult. Rather than starting from square one, there are
guidelines to help make your architecture run efficiently.

#### 1. Evaluate migration methods

Even when engaging a consulting partner like Onica, establishing your architecture takes some
up-front time. At Onica, we use a migration method known as [Migration as Code](https://onica.com/amazon-web-services/migration/),
which automates migrations on an application-by-application basis through CI/CD pipelines. This
method encourages cloud-native thought more than a traditional lift-and-shift migration and can
lead to greater cost savings in the long run. However, it might involve a slower start, as it requires
more strategic planning to pick the right services and the best ways to set up the
environment. The result is applications that embrace the cloud, leveraging services for more effective results.

#### 2. Consider security and compliance

You need to make special considerations for security and compliance. No matter your
industry, security is a major concern for cloud consumers. By following the AWS Well-Architected
Framework Guidelines, you can ensure a cloud architecture that meets your security needs, even
if they follow a specific standard like PCI, HIPAA, or have requirements like GDPR.

#### 3. Aim to maximize performance and minimize costs

Finally, the right architecture is imperative for maximizing performance while keeping costs low.
These efficiency gains come from minimizing unused resources, rightsizing the infrastructure,
and designing applications to scale seamlessly.

Business transformation in the cloud is rooted in the leveraging of cloud services. It is not
enough to move your on-premise servers in a one-to-one fashion. In fact, this can prove detrimental
to finding success in the cloud. Instead, businesses looking to capitalize on their change in
infrastructure should adopt the cloud-native approach and focus on the adaptation of applications
to meet cloud best practices without limiting them to on-premise functionality. By choosing to
leverage automation, scalability, and flexibility, you can not only maximize cloud ROI
but significantly impact growth and opportunity as well.
