Salesforce is much more than a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. It
is an enterprise-wide software solution that allows you to run many aspects of
your business, increase your companyâ€™s ROI, and improve efficiency within your
organization. You can customize it to meet the demands of any business,
regardless of your business model. Take a look into the Salesforce Ecosystem.

### Salesforce capabilities and AppExchange

You can run your Sales, Marketing, Customer Service and Support,
Business Intelligence, Accounting, Project Planning/Tracking, and more initiatives on the
Salesforce platform. The [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/) has
exponentially grown to over 3,000 certified apps! They give you access to
business apps, components, consultants, and partners so you can customize
Salesforce to fit your business needs. Some prevalent apps include the following:

- E-signature apps, such as [HelloSign](http://www.hellosign.com/),
  [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/), and [Adobe Sign](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/sign.html) (formerly EchoSign))
- Email analytics and workflow apps such as Salesforce IQ, 
- Geo-mapping aps, such as [Map Anything](http://mapanything.com/)
- Marketing analytics
- Accounting and ERP integration, and more. 

Rackspace can help you with implementation, new enhancements, ongoing projects, and recurring Salesforce maintenance.</br>

In addition to the annual Salesforce user conference Dreamforce, there are also
hundreds of [local and partner events](http://www.salesforce.com/events/). 
These events are an excellent way to
increase adoption, answer your pressing business challenges, and allow the
opportunity to network with Salesforce experts and customers about their
Salesforce journeys. Frequent Salesforce Partner events give you
the most bang for your Salesforce investment buck.
