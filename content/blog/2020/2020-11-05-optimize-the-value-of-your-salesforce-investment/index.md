Salesforce is much more than a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. It
is an enterprise-wide software solution that allows you to run many aspects of
your business, increase your companyâ€™s ROI, and improve efficiency within your
organization. It can be customized to meet the demands of any business,
regardless of your business model. Take a look into the Salesforce Ecosystem.

### Salesforce Capabilities and AppExchange

You are able to run your Sales, Marketing, Customer Service and Support,
Business Intelligence, Accounting, Project Planning/Tracking, and more on the
Salesforce platform. The [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/) has
exponentially grown to over 3,000 certified apps! They give you access to
business apps, components, consultants, and partners so you can customize
Salesforce to fit your business needs. Some prevalent apps include E-signature
apps such as [HelloSign](http://www.hellosign.com/),
[DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/), and [Adobe Sign](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/sign.html) (formally EchoSign), email
analytics and workflow such as Salesforce IQ, geo-mapping such as [Map Anything](http://mapanything.com/), marketing analytics, accounting and ERP
integration, and more! RelationEdge is able to assist with implementation, new
enhancements, as well as ongoing projects and recurring Salesforce maintenance.</br>
