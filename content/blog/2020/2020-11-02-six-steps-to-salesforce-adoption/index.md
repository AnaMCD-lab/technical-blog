### Sponsorship

In the initial stages of your project, it is imperative to establish a wide
support base throughout your organization. Good practice is to start at the
executive level, guaranteeing you are receiving top quality assistance from the
top, down. To ensure their support, executives must understand how Salesforce
will help grow their business, such as by increasing revenue and engagement
within your support team. Involving executives initially, and building a
business case around them, will establish credibility and success.

### Enablement

Make the Salesforce platform an enabler of business visions and objectives. Once
you have the executive level buy-in, create a unique business case, focusing on
the entire lead to cash business process including sales, marketing,
fulfillment, customer service/success, and finance. This focus provides a way to
enable your entire process within your environment.

### Usage

Measure the usage based on the following roadmap: First, define an
implementation plan and then focus on adoption. To do this, teams should focus
on defining the metrics around adoption, login day-to-day versus just
pipelines in each of these areas. It is also important to focus on driving the
right levels of metrics around each specific domain to ensure usage is evolving.
Of course, metrics will be different depending on the department observed,
whether it is marketing seen through lead generation or sales seen through
opportunities.

### Management

Drive behavior through productivity gains and management visibility of key
metrics. There are two aspects to these key metrics:

- Make the platform simple and accessible enough to make an individual able to
  use it.
- Keep the management involved in monitoring activity. Management should be
  monitoring key metrics as well as organizing their Salesforce dashboards to
  track these metrics.

### Data Management

Be relentless with data quality through data validation procedures and by
keeping it simple, setting up standards and encouraging your team to follow
these procedures. Data Management can ensure good data by eliminating the chance
for duplicate accounts and inaccurate information and having procedures in place
allows better visibility, quality data & accurate pipelines. Salesforce provides
many tools to help with data quality and proper implementation can help provide
processes within your organization.

### Training

Providing timely training, including sharing best practices, successes, challenges & feedback received, will keep your team ever-evolving and up to date. Examples of training methods could include in-person seminars, how-to training videos, and lunch & learns. Providing regular and appropriate training will ensure your business is continuing to improve user adoption.
