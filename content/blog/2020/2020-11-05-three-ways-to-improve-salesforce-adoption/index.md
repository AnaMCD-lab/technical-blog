There are plenty of articles on Salesforce adoption, each with several pages of
advice to sift through. However, at Rackspace, we have found that companies with
carefully-planned Salesforce&reg; implementations don't struggle with user
adoption.

What do these implementations have in common? They are **simple**, **designed** with
only one way through the maze of your business process, and **nurtured** by a healthy
feedback loop. With that in mind, follow these steps:

### Keep it simple

A well-designed Salesforce implementation keeps simplicity as its core tenet, including
the following suggestions:

- Require minimal data entry to build the big picture elegantly and
  accurately.
- Hide or remove unused tabs, data fields, reports, dashboards, and other
  distractions.
- Use common-sense names for custom fields.
- Tailor the user interface for teams by role.

### Navigate the maze

{{<img src="maze-mouse.jpg" title="" alt="" width="350">}}

Consider your business process as a maze and all the users as mice trying to
find their cheese. Make your maze as simple as possible to navigate and
make sure there is *cheese* at the end of the maze.

Here are a few examples:

- **Sales team**: Quota achievement and compensation.
- **Marketing team**: A well-executed campaign with visibility of the return on
  investment.
- **Product Management team**: Insight into key trending, pricing, and
  discounting information.
- **Operations team**: One-click, or automated, reporting.
- **Executive team**: Key insight into what has been sold and what is likely to
  close in the future. This can also make it easier to monitor a sales
  representative's performance and encourage friendly competition that
  ultimately improves the bottom line.

To design an effective business system, ensure that Salesforce
is the only way through the maze to get to the cheese. For example, if you
design your quoting and contracting process such that the only way to send a
customer a contract for signature is by using the electronic signature tool launched from
a button from within Salesforce, you likely achieve the following:

- A solid product catalog, because this is the only way to craft your quote.
- Defined business logic on how your products can be quoted, priced, and
  discounted.
- Visibility and trend reporting on the previous two items in tehis list.
- Complete and accurate Account and Contact information, because this is where
  the contract template gets its data.
- Impressed customers. They love the fact that you are able to put an
  accurate quote in their hands quickly and that they can take action on it without any
  printing, scanning, and uploading.

### Feedback loop

The beauty of Salesforce is that, just like your business, it is always
improving, evolving, and changing. If you plan your system administration and
enhancements with this in mind, you will lead to great success.

What does this entail from a practical perspective?

- Designate a single “key user” in each department with the passion and aptitude
  to gather feedback from their team and work with the system administrators to
  make adjustments to items that affect specific teams.
- Review upcoming releases and share information about features relevant to your
  business.
- When users complain, *listen*! Sometimes they are just venting, but you can often
  address these complaints with small adjustments, making their maze navigation all
  the more enjoyable.

### It’s never too late

Many companies implemented Salesforce years ago, and they have complex systems
that are difficult to navigate. Somewhere amid the chaos, they have
overlooked important data and key business trend information. If this sounds
like your business, don’t panic. You do not have to start over to achieve wide
adoption of Salesforce.

Here are some recommendations to help you take steps in the right direction:

- Take a top-down approach to tidy up your system. Remove unneeded applications
  and features to make it easier to find *the good stuff*.
- Design your ideal process on paper. You’ve probably heard the old adage in
  construction: *measure twice, cut once*. If you begin with design and map out
  a solid business process, you can modify Salesforce to support that process.
- Get help. Countless Salesforce engineers have solved similar
  problems numerous times and can help you avoid mistakes they have seen along
  the way. It can be a worthwhile investment to take advantage of their
  expertise and find yourself thrilled with your redesigned, simple maze.
