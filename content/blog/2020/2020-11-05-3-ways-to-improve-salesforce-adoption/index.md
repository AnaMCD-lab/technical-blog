There are plenty of articles on Salesforce adoption, each with several pages of
advice to sift through. At Rackspace, we have found that companies with
carefully-planned Salesforce implementations are not struggling with user
adoption.

What do these implementations have in common? They are **simple**, **designed** with
only one way through the “maze” of your business process and **nurtured** by a healthy
feedback loop. With that in mind, follow these steps.

### Keep it simple

A well-designed Salesforce implementation keeps simplicity as its core tenet. This can include:

- Requiring minimal data entry to build the big picture elegantly and
  accurately.
- Hiding or removing unused tabs, data fields, reports, dashboards, and other
  distractions.
- Using common sense names for custom fields.
- Tailoring the user interface for teams by role.

### The Maze

{{<img src="maze-mouse.jpg" title="" alt="" width="350" style="float:right">}}
Consider your business process as a **maze** and all the users as mice trying to
find their cheese. Make your “maze” as simple as possible to navigate, but also
make sure there is “cheese” at the end of the maze.

Here are a few examples:

- **Sales team**: Quota achievement and compensation.
- **Marketing team**: A well-executed campaign with visibility to the return on
  investment.
- **Product Management team**: Insight into key trending, pricing, and
  discounting information.
- **Operations team**: One-click, or automated, reporting.
- **Executive team**: Key insight into what has been sold and what is likely to
  close in the future. This can also make it easier to monitor sales
  representative's performance and encourage friendly competition that
  ultimately improves the bottom line.

An effective business system should be designed in a way that ensures Salesforce
is the only way through the maze to get to the cheese. For example, if you
design your quoting and contracting process such that the only way to send a
customer a contract for signature is via electronic signature tool launched from
a button from within Salesforce, you have likely achieved the following:

- A solid product catalog, because this is the only way to craft your quote.
- Defined business logic on how your products can be quoted, priced, and
  discounted.
- Visibility and trend reporting on items 1 and 2.
- Complete and accurate Account and Contact information, because this is where
  the contract template gets its data.
- Impressed customers. They love the fact that you are able to quickly put an
  accurate quote in their hands and that they can take action on it without any
  printing, scanning, and uploading.

### Feedback loop

The beauty of Salesforce is that, just like your business, it is always
improving, evolving, and changing. If you plan your system administration and
enhancements with this in mind, you will lead to great success.

What does this entail from a practical perspective?

- Designate a single “key user” in each department with the passion and aptitude
  to gather feedback from their team and work with the system administrators to
  make adjustments to items that affect specific teams.
- Review upcoming releases and share information about features relevant to your
  business.
- When users complain, LISTEN! Sometimes they are just venting, but
  oftentimes, these complaints can be addressed by making small adjustments
  which may result in making their maze navigation the more enjoyable.

### It’s never late

Many companies implemented Salesforce years ago and they have complex systems
that are difficult to navigate. Somewhere in the midst of the chaos, they have
overlooked important data and key business trend information. If this sounds
like your business, don’t panic. You do not have to start over to achieve wide
adoption of Salesforce.

Here are some recommendations to help you take steps in the right direction:

- Take a top-down approach to tidy up your system. Remove unneeded applications
  and features to make it easier to find *the good stuff*.
- Design your ideal process on paper. You’ve probably heard the old adage in
  construction: *“measure twice, cut once”*. If you begin with design and map out
  a solid business process, Salesforce can be modified to support that process.
- Get help. There are countless Salesforce engineers who have solved similar
  problems numerous times and can help you avoid mistakes they have seen along
  the way. It can be a worthwhile investment to take advantage of their
  expertise and find yourself thrilled with your own simple “maze”.
