Rackspace Technology is now offering colocation from data centers in Amsterdam
and Frankfurt.

<!--more-->

These facilities not only introduce the service to mainland Europe but also
bring the total number of data centers delivering
[Rackspace Colocation](https://www.rackspace.com/colocation) to an even 40. Like
the others, these locations are tethered to Rackspace’s global network backbone,
enabling customers to link hardware deployed at the two sites to Rackspace’s
full line up of multi-cloud services. Customers can also link to the top public
cloud providers across the globe in a cost-effective, secure, and optimized
fashion.

### Achieve data independence

Companies of all sizes frequently suffer sticker shock from their public cloud
bill. They’re well aware the public cloud’s *pay-by-the-drink* model comes at a
premium, but they’re flabbergasted by the line items attributed to data storage
and especially egress fees. Many don’t realize how expensive it is to get data
out of the public cloud after it’s migrated. Luckily, you can mitigate such
unpleasant surprises by keeping only what truly benefits from the elasticity and
native applications in the public cloud and *repatriate* everything else into
private environments that have predicable cost structures without sacrificing
performance.

With the addition of the Amsterdam and Frankfurt colocation data centers,
Rackspace customers can now deploy their own hardware investments and various
flavors of Rackspace Managed Private Cloud in concurrently maintainable data
centers.This lets them leverage [RackConnect Global](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud-connectivity/rackconnect/global)
to directly connect with all the major public cloud zones across the continent
over Rackspace’s private, low latency backbone. The *east-west* traffic flowing
between the colocation workloads and the public clouds avoids the public internet,
optimizing security and performance. Thus, customers can emancipate their data
from the underlying compute infrastructure, so only what has to be there is
deployed in the public cloud, helping minimize costly storage and egress charges.

### Marry colocation with public cloud

RackConnect Global delivers direct, private pathways between the new colocation
facilities and one or multiple public clouds via layer-3 Border Gateway Protocol
(BGP) sessions. So traffic flowing between any of the endpoints rides the Rackspace
private backbone and not the public internet. Fast, secure connections are not
enough. You must also deploy infrastructure within the colocation data centers
interoperable with the public cloud, so everything functions as a cohesive
environment even if it’s spread across the disparate infrastructure in separate
locations.

Customers interested in making a capital investment in hardware (or who already
have) can configure gear deployed in the new European colocation data centers
with the same hypervisors, containerization, and storage architecture as their
public-cloud environments. Alternatively, Rackspace can deploy its orchestration
layer on top of customer-owned assets and subsequently manage that infrastructure
through the [Rackspace Private Cloud Everywhere Edition](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private)
to guarantee interoperability.

For customers looking to avoid capital investments altogether, Private Cloud
Everywhere Edition, complete with Rackspace’s hyper-converged hardware, is also
available from the Amsterdam and Frankfurt facilities. A commonly enlisted
configuration that guarantees multi-cloud interoperability is deploying
[Rackspace Private Cloud powered by VMWare](https://www.rackspace.com/vmware/private-cloud)
in a colocation facility that’s linked via RackConnect Global to
[Rackspace Managed WMWARE Cloud on AWS](https://www.rackspace.com/vmware/vmc-on-aws).
With Rackspace managing both the public and private cloud environments all
virtualized on the same hypervisor flavor, you can ensure moving data in and out
of the public cloud happens smoothly and effectively.

### Rackspace Managed AWS Outposts

Another excellent way to take advantage of the new European Colocation data
centers is to deploy a Rackspace Managed AWS Outpost. AWS Outposts is a
fully-managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and
tools to virtually any data center. They’re ideal for workloads that require
low-latency access to on-premises systems, local data processing, or local data
storage. AWS doesn’t have an availability zone in the Netherlands, so customers
who need to keep their data within the country but want the environment to still
operate as an extension of their AWS environment can deploy an Outpost within
the new Rackspace Amsterdam colocation facility.

With RackConnect Global, the localized Outpost can be connected directly back
to an AWS Availability Zone so that data can flow securely and expediently
between the private AWS environment (the Outpost) and the AWS public cloud at
large. Customers can also leverage
[Rackspace Teams](https://www.rackspace.com/resources/rackspace-service-blocks-rackspace-teams-aws)
to help address their migration to AWS Outposts and facilitate cloud-native
application modernization.

### Expedite AI/ML

There are great artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
applications offered directly by the major public cloud providers that can
generate significant value for users of all stripes when fed proprietary data.
Historically, users who sought these solutions conducted a wholesale migration
of all their data stores to the public cloud, which is costly and might take weeks,
if not months, to execute. However, some available technologies work in
multi-cloud environments and intelligently cache only the data in the public
cloud that must flow through the AI and ML engines, which often is only 3%-5%.
This capability enables algorithms to start working on data primarily
stored in private cloud environments almost immediately, avoiding excessive
storage and egress charges.

### Colocation 3.0

Thinking of colocation as a solution reserved for non-virtualized, legacy
infrastructure and applications does not do it justice. Rather, you should
consider it to be a connectivity-rich foundation within which you can deploy
dynamic IT configurations that take advantage of the most forward-thinking
technologies and IT strategies. Rackspace Colocation is a launchpad for digital
transformation, ushering in the concept of Colocation 3.0, which we explore in
our white paper:
