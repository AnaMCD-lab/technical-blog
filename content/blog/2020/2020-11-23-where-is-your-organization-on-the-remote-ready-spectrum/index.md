The spread of COVID-19 has pushed many organizations to adopt remote work
policies &mdash; a trend that was accelerating long before today’s
crisis. Although many organizations might only need to temporarily enable a 100% remote
workforce, this sudden disruption in their day-to-day routine
puts a spotlight on areas of the business that might not be as digitally
mature as they could be. As a result, businesses are looking for strategies
to quickly enable their workforce in the event of another crisis.

### Signs of your remote readiness

Whether your workforce is entirely office-bound or you already have
some form of a remote enablement program in place, it’s important
that you’re prepared to enable work from home policies in an
instant. Even a brief lapse in workload
continuity can mean thousands of lost sales opportunities, disruption
to production, and compromised customer trust.

So, where do you fall on the remote-readiness spectrum? While there are
many variables to consider, you can begin to assess your maturity with the
following benchmarks:

#### Signs that you're office-bound

- Every worker is physically in the office every day
- Rely primarily on on-premises, legacy or proprietary applications
- Limited or complex access procedures
- Desktop workstations
- Enabling remote work feels like a significant challenge

#### Signs that you’re remote-ready

- Significant amount contingent or remote workers
- Rely on cloud-based applications and file storage
- BYOD or company-issued laptop standards
- Remote collaboration and telecommunication is the norm
