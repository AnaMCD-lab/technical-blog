The spread of COVID-19 has pushed many organizations to adopt remote work
policies&mdash;a trend that was accelerating long before today’s
crisis. Although many organizations might only need to temporarily enable a 100% remote
workforce, this sudden disruption in their day-to-day routine
puts a spotlight on areas of the business that might not be as digitally
mature as they could be. As a result, businesses are looking for strategies
to enable their workforce in the event of another crisis quickly.

### Signs of your remote readiness

Whether your workforce is entirely office-bound or you already have
some form of a remote enablement program in place, you have to
be prepared to enable work from home policies in an
instant. Even a brief lapse in workload
continuity can mean thousands of lost sales opportunities, disruption
to production, and compromised customer trust.

So, where do you fall on the remote-readiness spectrum? While there are
many variables to consider, you can begin to assess your maturity with the
following benchmarks:

#### Signs that you're office-bound

- Every worker is physically in the office every day.
- You rely primarily on on-premises, legacy, or proprietary applications.
- YOu have limited or complex access procedures.
- Employees use desktop workstations.
- Enabling remote work feels like a significant challenge.

#### Signs that you’re remote-ready

- You have a significant number of contingent or remote workers.
- You rely on cloud-based applications and file storage.
- BYOD or company-issued laptop are standard.
- Remote collaboration and telecommunication is the norm.

### From office-bound to remote-ready in an instant

Regardless of where you fall in the remote readiness spectrum, we designed our
[AWS&reg; Business Continuity solutions](https://onica.com/amazon-web-services/business-continuity-solutions/)
to meet you where you are. For organizations with less mature policies in place, the three most
impactful AWS solutions that [enable remote workforce
productivity](https://onica.com/blog/business-continuity/enabling-remote-workforce-productivity-with-aws/)
today are [Amazon&reg; WorkSpaces](https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/?workspaces-blogs.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&workspaces-blogs.sort-order=desc),
[Amazon AppStream 2.0](https://onica.com/blog/business-continuity/enabling-remote-workforce-productivity-with-aws/),
and [AWS Client VPN](https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/client-vpn-download/).

Suppose that most of your users need access to everything on their desktops but aren’t yet
accustomed to cloud-based applications or don’t have easy access to remote collaboration tools.
In that case, Amazon WorkSpaces lets you access your entire desktop anywhere,
any time, from any device.

If you have some GPU intensive programs that your team needs or you have critical
non-SaaS applications you need access to right away, Amazon AppStream 2.0 can enable
secure application delivery to any supported device via a web browser.

If your team needs to quickly and easily access your network or file storage,
AWS Client VPN offers AWS on-premises connectivity from anywhere.
