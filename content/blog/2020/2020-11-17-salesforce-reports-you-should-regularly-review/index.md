### Lead source effectiveness

Understanding lead source effectiveness is crucial to the success of your business.
Companies in every industry need to understand the importance of their lead sources. Do
the majority of leads come from trade shows, referrals, or partner companies? What are the
details of these, including lead conversion rates and average deal size? These are all
factors that help uncover the type and quality of deals each lead source generates.
Additionally, data insights help determine whether to focus on current lead sources or
change processes to diversify sources. Consider running a *Lead Lifetime Report* and
*Opportunity Sources Report* to determine lead source effectiveness in Salesforce.

### Customer engagement

In addition to analyzing lead source effectiveness, you should also understand touchpoints
and patterns where customers engage with your product, service, or organization. When
reviewing accounts and prospects, it's crucial to know where most touchpoints are occurring.
What drives a prospect to open your email, fill out the *Contact Us** form, and engage with
your business? To understand the big picture, you must review all customer engagement
stages, including your outbound reach, the customer's independent reach, and reciprocal
engagement. Consider creating a
[Customer Engagement Center Strategy](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2014/04/customer-engagement-center-strategy.html)
to provide context around customer engagement.

### Sales Pipelines and Duration

- Sales pipelines: For every business, there is a multitude of dimensions for sales
  analysis. While the active pipeline is always a core area of focus, you should also
  review the unattained pipeline. Understanding the reasons why a deal didn't close
  provides an opportunity to learn and improve other pursuits. Run a
  *Standard Opportunity Report* to report on your opportunity pipeline, history, sources,
  and types.
- Sales duration: To sustain a healthy business, you should understand how long it takes
  for various types of opportunities to close. Using that data as a baseline, you can nurture
  opportunities in the right priority. Moreover, this provides the possibility to see sales
  at a higher level and adjust processes if needed. To determine Sales Duration, run the
  *Opportunity Stage Duration Report* in Salesforce.

### Sales profitability

You made the sale, but how much profit does your business realize from those efforts?
Reporting on profit margin also helps set sales priorities and identify areas for process
improvements. Companies selling goods with fixed costs can easily calculate the estimated
margin. However, companies selling services need to pull together costs at the end of
financial reporting periods. In either scenario, you should consider estimated margins to
be reporting requirements from the onset. Run a *Lifetime Value Calculation* in Salesforce
to learn the total cost to acquire a client, the cost to support the client, and the client's
real profit.

### Conclusion

Every company can benefit from multi-dimensional reporting. Decisions based on data insights
lead to greater efficiencies and improved results. For your Salesforce reporting needs,
