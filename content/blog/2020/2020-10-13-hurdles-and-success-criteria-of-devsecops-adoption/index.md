DevSecOps integrates security practices, principles, tooling, and knowledge into
all stages of the software development life cycle within an Agile framework. It
aims to enforce security in every stage of the DevOps process compared to the
traditional practice, where security assurance is typically performed late in
the software delivery life cycle.

With this *shifting left* approach, you can minimize security attacks and
breaches and tremendously improve an application's overall security posture by
detecting vulnerabilities early. In fact, based on a Forrester Research report,
a transition from DevOps to DevSecOps is one of the top five priorities for IT
security and risk leaders in 2019 and beyond.

### The hurdles

However, while DevSecOps sounds great in theory, it is difficult to implement
and often meets with resistance in practice, including the following hurdles:

#### Hurdle 1: Resistance from the DevOps team

According to a survey by Threat Stack&reg;, 68% of companies state that their
CEO demands security but that DevOps teams are reluctant to adopt better practices
because they see security as a major constraint on the ability to deliver
software quickly. Many developers traditionally focus on project deadlines,
feature functionality, and product time to market, and they still don't fully
appreciate the importance of application security. This disconnect is one of the
biggest challenges of DevSecOps and explains why many quit the transition
halfway.

#### Hurdle 2: Lack of DevSecOps expertise

The lack of DevSecOps experts is another challenge. DevSecOps are usually
application security experts who work as part of the application development
team to write secure code and integrate security in the CI/CD pipelines. However,
two in five organizations have yet to hire a DevSecOps expert. DevSecOps engineers
are becoming highly sought after, but it is not easy to hire the right candidates
with the right skillsets.

Candidates need a thorough understanding of popular programming languages and
should be familiar with CI/CD tools, security tooling, automation tools. They
should also be up to speed with microservices and Kubernetes&reg;, along with
major cloud hosting providers, such as AWS&reg;, Azure&reg;, and GCP&reg;.
Retaining these talents once you hire them is another uphill task for most
organizations. The low availability of security professionals with DevOps skills
is a challenge that particularly affects small to medium enterprises (SME).

#### Hurdle 3: DevSecOps adoption without the right automation tools in place

Automation is the key to DevSecOps adoption. Working toward a GitOps model of
application delivery, in which humans perform little to no manual intervention
in application deployments, reduces the risk of human error and tampering. The
most common DevSecOps adoption mistake is implementing DevSecOps without scaled
automation that all the relevant stakeholders understand well and trust.

There are plenty of tools available in the market now to implement DevSecOps.
The first challenge lies in choosing ones that fit well with your organization.
The second challenge is properly integrating them to build, deploy, and test
deliverables in a continuous manner. It's not easy to bring together tools from
various departments and sync them on one platform. This dilemma becomes even
more challenging when most of the enterprise embraces hybrid clouds. That's why
choosing the right tooling, such as Google&reg; Anthos&reg;, which helps enforce
security policy, validate, and manage configuration drifts across hybrid Kubernetes
clusters, is crucial for the success of DevSecOps adoption.

### DevSecOps adoption success criteria

The success of DevSecOps relies on three foundational pillars&mdash;people,
process, and technology.

#### People

How can we cultivate a DevSecOps culture? How do we instill security awareness
into the DevOps team? How do we train the developers on basic security so that
they can be in a better position to collaborate effectively with the security
team?

Every process begins with people. The core of DevOpsOps lies in how well the
development team, operation team, and security team integrate. You should bridge
the gap between traditional silos in these teams by empowering cross-functional
teams. Sponsorship from top management is crucial to drive this cultural change.

#### Process

How do we implement DevSecOps? What is the right DevSecOps process?

No single DevSecOps approach fits all organizations. Adopting DevSecOps is a
drawn-out process, and you need the patience to improve and adjust your strategy
along the journey. Start small with DevSecOps. Begin with one scrum team
and one project, and establish security as code and an automatable set of
security checks and processes that other teams can use. Then improve on your
process, and do it again. Repeatability is a path for scalability.

#### Technology

What are the right technologies and tooling to enable DevSecOps adoption? How
do we ensure that the selected tools can be adapted to help the developers?

Security solutions that use an automation-first and API-driven approach play a
key role in this aspect. The right automation tooling can eliminate the
*security causes delays* mentality. By detecting and fixing security issues
during the development phases, you can deliver faster and reduce costs in the
long run.

### Conclusion

It is impossible to have a completely smooth process right off the bat. However,
overcoming hurdles creates opportunities for improvements to your efficiency and
effectiveness. Most importantly, start the DevSecOps journey early and be patient,
so your organization can see the light of success and value at the end of the
tunnel.
