bio: "At ObjectRocket (a Rackspace company), I moved over to 
the marketing side of the house, learned new magic on how to get out the word 
about our great DBaaS offerings, and leveraged my previous content 
and community experience. I focused on creating technical marketing content 
(mostly blogs) and social media (yay Twitter!), plus doing a bit of work with 
the dev teams on tech docs. This role took me back full circle to databases, 
where I started out 20+ years ago. ;-) Rackspace ObjectRocket provides database expertise
and management of several popular databases in the Cloud&mdash;they do the database work, 
and enable developers to focus on their application's product design and coding, 
not the underlying DB."

A little over a year ago, we started our journey to bring CockroachDB into the ObjectRocket portfolio, and now we have
upgraded our offering to General Availability status. This means that fully-managed CockroachDB on our Kubernetes-based
platform is ready for production workloads, and you can expect the full Rackspace ObjectRocket support experience.
Read on to learn more about our fully managed CockroachDB offering. The power of CockroachDB is truly something to behold,
and at Rackspace ObjectRocket, we feel that it is where the market is going from a SQL database technology perspective.
The distributable nature, along with its scaling, balancing, and self-healing capabilities, make it such a powerful tool
for users who are building or moving towards a truly modern application in the cloud.

Before now, it might have been too expensive to have somebody else focus on manage your data layer while you focus on your core
functionality and customer experience. However, with ObjectRocket’s Managed CockroachDB, you can now start leveraging the power of
CockroachDB, which is backed by a full SLA with a team of experts available 24x7x365, with the features that you expect from an
enterprise-level offering.

### CockroachDB features available today

Over the last year, since we took
[ObjectRocket Managed CockroachDB to Beta](https://www.objectrocket.com/blog/cockroachdb/the-cockroach-we-love-grows-beta-announcement/),
we have been hard at work improving the stability of the offering and adding functionality. Here is an overview of some of the main
features that are available today:

+ **Node Types:** Two different node types (Basic and Standard) with three different storage sizes for each type. Each of the node types
has different resource allocations to match the intended use cases. This gives you options to choose from when building your
CockroachDB cluster.

+ **Security:** We enabled IP Whitelists and TLS in all instances. You have a choice in how they have your users authenticate.
You can download a cluster-specific CA and even have individual user certificates if necessary.

+ **Backups:** Each cluster is backed up daily with 14-day retention. You can request a restore from backup by opening a support ticket.

+ **Scaling:** You can add or remove nodes easily on a cluster as your workload needs change over time. All of this happens with no downtime.

+ **Monitoring:** The ObjectRocket support team has access to and is actively monitoring over 250 metrics on every CockroachDB cluster.
We handle issues proactively without you needing to get involved. We handle any issues that need your attention via a support ticket.

+ **Dashboard Integration:** You can now provision, manage, and get insights on your CockroachDB cluster through our new UI
(Mission Control) with such tools as [Grafana&reg;](https://www.objectrocket.com/blog/features/introducing-metrics-dashboards-on-objectrocket/)
metrics and [Role-Base Access Control](https://www.objectrocket.com/blog/features/single-sign-on-and-role-based-access-control-are-coming-to-objectrocket/).

+ **Proactive Database Administration:** The ObjectRocket support team is continuously evaluating CockroachDB clusters for improvement
opportunities. This ranges from query and resource-utilization analysis to configuration tweaks. If we notice something, we reach out
to you through a support ticket. This team is also available for any architectural or design consultations around your CockroachDB usage.

#### Beyond General Availability

Throughout this year, we focused heavily on the multi-region capability of CockroachDB. You can build a fully-distributed
CockroachDB cluster across multiple regions and get the full benefit of CockroachDB’s capabilities along with our ObjectRocket
database expertise. In the meantime, you should feel comfortable leveraging this offering in any production environment. If your
needs don’t match the current plan definitions or you have questions about the offering, reach out to our database specialists.
