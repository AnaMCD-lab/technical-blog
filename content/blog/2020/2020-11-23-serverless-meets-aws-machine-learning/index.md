In the first blog post in this series, I presented several architectural
patterns that can be used to implement a simple website for showcasing images

presented, the two serverless architectures
with static website hosting were close runners, and allowed me to build a
high performing and highly scalable solution that is quick to provision and
easy to manage.

AppSync due to the built-in support for web and mobile applications, and
the speed of full stack development provided by the AWS Amplify ecosystem.
