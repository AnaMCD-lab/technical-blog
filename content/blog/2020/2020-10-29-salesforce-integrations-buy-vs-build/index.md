Understanding your options, the implementation details required, and the necessary investment is
key when trying to reach your company goals because it gives you clarity and aids your decision making.

<!--more-->

Salesforce has many capabilities and has over 3,000 free or low-cost apps in the AppExchange. As you grow your
capabilities, you might find an application covering some of the functionality you require. The big decision you
need to make is whether to buy one of these apps or build a solution from scratch that is custom-tailored to what
you do. Going through a thoughtful process on your *build vs. buy* decision saves your company both time and money.

### Options

Begin by assessing what applications you use today. Many applications integrate directly with Salesforce. You should
understand whether these applications can scale to where you want to grow, especially if you have significant near-term
growth goals. A convenient place to assess your integration options and review alternative applications is the Salesforce
AppExchange. A simple keyword search often returns a large number of applications in any given category. As you begin to
understand your application options, factor in the change process to replace an application in one of your departments.
For example, suppose your Finance Team is deeply embedded in Quickbooks. You might choose an application connector to
allow them to continue to work in Quickbooks but make the data available in Salesforce for better management visibility
and collaboration. The deciding factor of your final options should be your growth plan, not the specific technology.

### Details

Your data is your intellectual property and is a key decision factor in your integration. You have to decide how current
the information you use must be to make the best business decisions. You need real-time integrations for instant up-to-the-second
data across systems. Other data might have longer cycles that are measured in minutes, hours, or days and can be updated in bulk
by using less-costly batch methods. While looking at the data, you should consider whether they reside on deprecated technologies
because this might be an opportunity to consolidate data sources. You ultimately need to make this data available in a
security-controlled way. You should also review the usage of the data by marketing, sales, service, and operations so that you have
a clear picture of each groupâ€™s requirements. The right data at the right time streamlines your processes and minimizes your
long-term costs.

### Investment

As you begin to finalize your build vs. buy decision, take one more look at your requirements. You want to make your decision based
on the minimum viable product requirements to accomplish your business objectives&mdash;separate, genuine must-haves from your wish
list, based on business criticality. If you have outgrown your existing systems, make sure your new solution gives you enough headroom
for your planned growth for the next few years. Next, review the cost of your existing systems, including the cost of any remaining
subscription or maintenance services. Understanding when these terminate might help you determine your transition timing. Then, make
a side-by-side *build versus buy* cost comparison to create cost clarity. This analysis should include both your one-time and recurring
costs because this comparison might be a tipping point in your decision. With these costs known, plan out the efficiencies you gain
with a streamlined process and freed-up team capacity. You can use these efficiencies to reduce your long-term costs and fuel your
business growth.
