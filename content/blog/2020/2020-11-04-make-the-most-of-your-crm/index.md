Traditionally, companies use Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms 
to help track and store their key business contacts and the activities and
opportunities associated with these contacts. The use of a CRM has
expanded far beyond this, and companies more commonly use CRMs as a business platform
to perform **Marketing Automation**, **Proposal and Contract Management**,
**Advanced Reporting and Analytics**, and **Inventory and Financial Management**.
The Salesforce Platform provides both basic and advanced capabilities to help
companies grow beyond the traditional use of a CRM. Following are some examples of Salesforce
capabilities:

### Marketing

Salesforce provides the ability to do automated lead tracking and assignment to capture all leads.
It also provides an easy way to respond if the lead has an immediate interest in your
companyâ€™s products or services or to nurture a lead who is not quite ready to
make a buying decision. You can develop a variety of campaigns to keep your clients
informed of new products and services, news updates, and thought leadership messages.

### Sales Proposals

You can manage the proposal process directly in Salesforce so that you can
present client documents such as quotes and proposals from Salesforce. Track
and manage statuses according to your sales process without having to go into
another system to inform your clients.

### Customer Support

Manages customer inquiries and support issues directly from Salesforce so that
you can have a complete view of your customer and can make future product and
service decisions based on the insights you have from **Sales and Support**
in Salesforce.

### Analytics and Reporting

You can turn the data maintained within Salesforce into reports easily. You can
create basic dashboards for the core data you maintain in Salesforce, such as
pipeline, average deal size, lead status, campaign reporting, and so on. Easily
build, customize, and refresh dashboards so that you can see the
status of your business in real time and gain insight in a nice clean
dashboard view.

### Applications to further expand your CRM capabilities

One of the most impressive and powerful tools available to Salesforce customers
is the **AppExchange** where you have a variety of free and paid applications that
integrate with Salesforce to further enhance your use of Salesforce. Use these tools
and applications to customize Salesforce to meet your precise needs.
