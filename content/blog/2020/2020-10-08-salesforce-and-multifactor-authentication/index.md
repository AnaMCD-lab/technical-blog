In today's world, where everything we do seems to be virtual and online,
threats that compromise security to your login credentials grow more common.
That said, it's important to employ strong security measures to protect your
personal and business applications. That's why you should consider implementing
multi-factor authentication (MFA)&mdash;it helps to prevent common attacks such
as phishing, keyloggers, and brute force attacks.

### What is MFA?

MFA is a security mechanism that requires an individual to supply two or more
credentials to authenticate their identity to gain access to an application. It
verifies a user's identity and is more secure than the typical username-password
combination, known as single-factor authentication.

Authentication factors include something you know (such as login credentials),
something you have (such as an Authenticator app or security key), and something
you are (such as biometrics or fingerprints). Adding this layer of security
prevents unauthorized access and other security threats.

### How to use MFA with Salesforce

In Salesforce&reg;, enabling MFA is a simple and effective way to secure your
organization, protecting against those common attacks. Using Single Sign-On (SSO)
also enhances your security. Salesforce supports the following MFA verification
methods:

- Third-Party Authenticator Apps such as Google&reg; Authenticator and
  Microsoft&reg; Authenticator Authy
- Security Keys such as Yubico&reg; YubiKey or Google Titan&trade; Security Key
- [Salesforce Authenticator mobile app](https://salesforce.vidyard.com/watch/JyZ_mibupf6sOzMwvhtA3g)

Salesforce Authenticator is a free mobile app available for both iOS&reg; and
Android&reg; users. It's user friendly, and you can simply approve or deny
logins from your device.

With the upcoming *Winter '21 Release*, Salesforce makes implementing MFA even
easier with the **Multi-Factor Authentication Assistant**. The MFA Assistant
helps Salesforce administrators to plan and roll it out across an organization.
Salesforce highly recommends turning on MFA for all user interface logins.
