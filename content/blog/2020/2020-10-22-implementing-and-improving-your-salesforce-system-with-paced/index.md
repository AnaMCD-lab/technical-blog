Use PACED for a successful technology implementation experience so that your
systems stay relevant as you continue to evolve your business.

### What is PACED?

PACED is Rackspace’s process and technology implementation methodology, which we
have used successfully in over 1,700 projects. It leverages flexible and agile
techniques that are useful for new [Salesforce implementations](/blog/process-first-the-importance-of-business-process-reviews-for-salesforce-implementation/) as well as systems that have evolved and matured over time with your company’s
growth. Our phase-based approach aims to create a predictable outcome for
your project with a sharp and collaborative focus on using technology to attain
your business goals.

### PACED phases

The phases of PACED comprise the following steps:

**Prepare**: Our goal is to help you achieve the earliest possible return on
your investment in Salesforce while balancing the amount of time
required from your team to make the project successful. Because collaboration is a
key element to success, we map the planned activities to a timeline, so we can
engage the right knowledge holders at the right time. We also align our execution
plan to your key business milestones to measure progress intelligently together.
This phase ensures that we have a well-organized start to your
project and ensures that your business goals are top of mind for all project
team members.

**Architect**: We work with you and your knowledge holders to understand your
business process and determine the business and technical success factors for
your project. If there are opportunities for complexity reduction, we review
them with you because this process often creates efficiencies within your organization.
We then synthesize our understanding of your process into clear requirements for a
business-aligned Salesforce system. This enables you to prioritize the
requirements that drive results and potentially reduce the
*nice to haves* in your system design. Building on a minimum viable product
basis and then adding features keeps your goals in focus. We catalog
any unused ideas for future phases. After we finalize the design, we turn our
attention to the plan for training your teams. This ensures that you
have excellent adoption of Salesforce as we mold it around your business.

**Construct**: This step is the physical implementation of your Salesforce
system. Through the previous steps, we created an outline of your system through
careful planning and preparation, but now we can fill in the blanks of your
system to make it functional. Our teams create the technical foundation that
enables you to scale your Salesforce system as your business grows. We layer in
the customizations that make your implementation as unique and distinct as your
business. If connections to other systems are part of your design, we establish
those interfaces. At this time, we install any 
[Salesforce AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/) products to add
additional capabilities to your system. As we iterate through constructing
Salesforce around your business goals, we invite you to verify key
processes and design elements so that the system delivers your functional
requirements.

**Evaluate**: We request that your team members aligned to the project evaluate
the system against the requirements established earlier in the project.  This
evaluation goes beyond the idea of user acceptance testing because we want to ensure
that Salesforce delivers the capabilities that anable you to measure and manage
your business. You should evaluate key business rules and process workflows that we
implemented to ensure that you achieve top-down and bottom-up
success when using the system. Verify that dashboards are easy to use and
have at-a-glance success metrics readability. We log, address, and retest any
defects. We perform our final preparations for training your
trainers or your team and get your Salesforce system ready for the final
phase.

**Deploy**: The last phase of our methodology transfers the updated process and
technology to you and your team for operational use. We load any applicable
legacy data into Salesforce and activate any interfaces with your other systems.
If we performed any coding as part of your project, we transfer that code
from your development sandbox to your production environment. You are now live
on Salesforce with your business-specific customizations. We execute the
training plan to create the competencies on your team that drive the
system's adoption and deliver your business results. Before closing the project, we
execute a review with you to ensure that we completed all deliverables and that
we have a plan in place to maintain your system. The catalog of ideas that we
captured earlier in our methodology usually form the next steps for further
enhancements. We offer continued collaboration to keep pace with your company’s
plans for long-term success with Salesforce so that the system stays relevant as
you continue to evolve your business.
