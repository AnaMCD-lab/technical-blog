If you are considering purchasing Salesforce.com or are already a customer, you might be
confused by the various license types. Do you need Group, Professional, Enterprise,
Performance, Unlimited, or Force.com? What does all of it mean?

Let's explore three of the choices:

- Lightning Professional
- Lightning Enterprise
- Lightning Unlimited

### Lightning Professional features

Some notable Lightning Professional features include the following:

- Two custom profiles, two permission sets, and two page layouts.
   - Custom profiles allow you to set user permissions. For example, you can do the following:
      - Allow users to see or not see objects like Leads, Accounts, or Opportunities.
      - Allow users to see, edit or not see fields like Name, Phone, or Address.
      - Allow users to run and export reports or run but not export reports.
   - Custom Permission Sets allow you to refine permissions further. You can assign
     Permission Sets to specific users to give them additional capabilities, like exporting
     reports.
   - Page Layouts allow you to tailor the fields a user sees on a record. You can include
     and exclude as well as change the order of fields on each layout.
- Field-level security allows you to make a field visible, editable, or invisible to
  specific users.
- Five process builder processes allow you to create automatic actions like:
   - Creating a record. For example, when an Opportunity is marked *Closed Won*, Lightning
     can create an Implementation Case, assign it to the right person or team, and
     pre-populate it with available information.
   - Updating fields. For example, change an Account from *Prospect* to *Customer* when you
     move an Opportunity to *Closed Won*.
   - Creating a task. For example, if a Lead is not contacted within 24 hours, create a
     task for the Owner to call the Lead.
- Three record types allow you to distinguish records, such as:
   - Customers versus Partners or Vendors
   - New Sales versus Renewals
- Sales Console allows you to more easily navigate among related records like Account,
  Contact, and Opportunity. Lightning Professional gets one standard Sales Console.
- Unlimited custom apps and tabs mean you can tailor the user experience to do the following:
   - Show only relevant tabs based on function.
      - Sales might see Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities, Cases
      - Customer Service might see Contacts Accounts, Cases
   - Create as many custom objects as you need. So, if you need Projects, Properties, Jobs,
     and Intakes, there is no limit.
- 10 Developer Sandboxes allow you lots of test environments so you can make sure the
  changes you are considering will work and not cause any problems before you make them in
  your live environment.

### Lightning Enterprise features

Lightning Enterprise includes all of the Professional features plus the following:

- Sales Console allows you to more easily navigate among related records like Account,
  Contact, and Opportunity. Lightning Enterprise gets unlimited, customizable Sales Consoles.
- One Partial Sandbox. This test environment brings over data in addition to the
  configuration that provides a much richer testing environment.

### Lightning Unlimited features

New Lightning Unlimited includes the following additional feature:

100 Developer Sandboxes allow you lots of test environments so you can make sure the
changes you are considering will work and not cause any problems before you make them in
your live environment.
