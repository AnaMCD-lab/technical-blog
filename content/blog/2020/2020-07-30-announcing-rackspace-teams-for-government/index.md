Rackspace Teams for Government is a unique engagement model that we purposely
developed based on feedback from government customers who asked for the ability
to access in-depth cloud expertise on-demand without any long-term commitments
or the need to hire a staff of their own.

### Introduction

In today's rapidly changing world, organizations want the flexibility to
dynamically change scope and priorities while leveraging world-class expertise
in multiple areas, including but not limited to:

- Amazon® Web Services (AWS) cloud
- Infrastructure as Code
- Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
- DevOps transformation
- Containers

### Challenges

The traditional consulting model, based on hourly time and material engagements
with pre-defined deliverables and milestones, is too rigid. Dealing with change
can be costly, particularly if the change is frequent or ongoing. Government
customers and the vendors who support them are continuously looking to bring the
speed and agility found in the private sector to bear on their solutions, and
Rackspace Teams for Government enables that.

### The Rackspace Teams for Government (AWS) solution

Rackspace Teams for Government (AWS) addresses the preceding challenges by
doing the following:

- Focus on a collaborative partnership with customers.
- Use disciplined agile project management methodologies.
- Build teams of highly skilled cloud engineers and architects with a strong IT
  operations background comprising only U.S. Citizens. These skills are
  particularly handy when you need to build, migrate workloads, optimize, or
  maintain live production environments.
- Rackspace provides the Teams service offering to customers who do not need
  onsite access.

### How it works

We provide on-demand access to highly skilled cloud experts to help you with
your toughest mission challenges, and we have an extensive background in managed
security and compliance. Organizations generally leverage Rackspace Teams for
Government (AWS) to achieve FedRAMP authorization on Rackspace Government Cloud
on AWS or when they need help to improve or optimize their existing authorized
Rackspace Government Cloud on AWS deployment. However, Rackspace Teams for
Government (AWS) is versatile and can be leveraged entirely on its own. With
Teams, Rackspace Technology is here to help you deliver timely, high-quality AWS
cloud solutions in support of your mission.

Customers engage with a Pod&mdash;a group of Rackers who are U.S. citizens.
A Pod consists of highly skilled senior and junior Rackers who proactively work
with customers to scope, define, and deliver "mini" cloud projects. Pod Rackers
use the Agile framework for software development and delivery. At the beginning
of each sprint, Pod Rackers curate a backlog of deliverables for the customer.
As a result of this grooming process, customers see real value delivered at the
end of each sprint.

An assigned engagement manager and Pod lead helps the customer plan projects for
Pod Rackers. We have completed some projects for our customers, including
building out CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes deployments, implementing enhanced
monitoring, and cloud migrations.

### Expertise

Rackspace Teams for Government provides unbiased expertise. Pod Rackers work
within your environment using tooling and technology sets that already exist
within your internal IT organization. For example, Customer A might use GitHub
along with CiricleCI® for source control and CI/CD, whereas Customer B might
use bitbucket and Jenkins®. Highly skilled Pod Rackers can help both customers
by adopting the tooling in place in each customer's environment. After helping
many customers in their journey to the cloud, we have developed expertise in
various cloud technologies such as Terraform® and AWS. We share this expertise
with our customers when they need us to support their mission.

Rackspace remains a leader in the FedRAMP authorization enablement space,
powering 12 FedRAMP ATOs built on its managed service. It provides 24x7x365
hybrid-cloud management, operational support, and security services that are a
packaged, on-demand, audited, and pay-as-you-go service.
