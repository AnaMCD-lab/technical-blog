Have you ever invested in a solution only to find, no one is using it (or using it as it
was intended)? This experience is a common struggle many businesses have encountered. 

<!--more-->

### Introduction

Leaders invest in applications with only the best intentions. They want to empower their
users with a management solution (other than Excel&reg;) that efficiently tracks opportunities
and customer information. Leaders even engage subject matter experts and invest in training
support to help improve end-user adoption. Yet despite these best efforts, implementations
still fail.

### How to succeed

Why is this, and what more can you do to protect a business' investment and empower users?
We have found that sometimes taking a more simplistic approach is the answer. By using a
crawl, walk, run approach, you win in three significant ways! 

1. Users start operating in the system quickly, which drives a rapid return on investment
and enables sales representatives to start using the system without major disruption to
their daily tasks. 

2. Because it is less disruptive, representatives are more likely to adopt the application.
Starting with core functionality means a less complicated solution and increased user
adoption. Take a moment to reflect on the effort required during an
implementation&mdash;data preparation, training, testing, and production conversion.
*Phew! That's a lot of effort before they even use the system!* Users are basically taking
on a second job, so make it as easy for them as possible!

3. Lastly, because you'll design future enhancements based on the team's experience of a
system they are already using, this can lead to more effectively planned process improvements
and a better return on investment overall. 

If you are looking for a sales and contact management solution, Rackspace Technology has
developed a partnership to bring our customers Microsoft&reg; Dynamics 365&reg; OnTrack
packaged offerings. We designed these packages with the preceding elements in mind and can
have representatives using Dynamics 365 Sales in as little as four-weeks with post-production
support.

### Dynamics 365 Sales OnTrack Packages

There are three packages to choose from: Premium, Preferred, and Basic.  The Basic plan is
for customers who are comfortable implementing and learning the solution on their own but
want access to training material and self-directed support. On the other hand, Premium and
Preferred packages are for customers looking for more hands-on support as they implement
and learn how to use Dynamics 365 Sales.

We base the packages on fixed-fee pricing, consisting of a one-time initial configuration
fee plus a monthly fee based on the number of users and package selected. The following
overview shows everything included in Dynamics 365 Sales OnTrack: 

-  Configuration of one Dynamics 365 Sales business unit
-  Data-migration
-  Video training
-  Configuration of Outlook and SharePoint integrations
-  Coaching calls *For Preferred and Premium packages only
-  Post-Production Concierge Check-ins *For Preferred and Premium packages only
-  Concierge support
-  Break/fix support 
-  OnTrack training access

**Break/fix support** is included in all plans, but the Premium and Preferred plans include
support for *How-do-I* questions. This support provides users access to experienced Dynamics
365 Sales professionals for basic questions, without worrying about being charged for every
question they ask. 

**OnTrack training** provides users access to visual screen guides, role-based training
guides, anytime role-based training videos, and What's New webcasts. Furthermore, each
package includes an OnTrack Sales Hub App, and the Preferred and Premium packages include
a Core Productivity extension and Sales Productivity extension while current on the plan.

### Not Yet Sold?

I can sum up the benefits in two words: simple and efficient. 

Maybe you already have an idea of all the customizations your business needs, so this
approach seems counter-intuitive. Your business is unique, yes. However, launching an
overly-configured or overly-customized CRM solution means longer implementations and
creates a system that is so complicated, no one knows how to operate it properly. 

I compare this to going to the grocery store hungry. You start adding things to your cart
that weren't on your list.  Then you get home and realize you don't have enough room in
your refrigerator (or belly) for all that food! You waste lots of money and literally throw
food in the garbage. 

Staying on the grocery shopping analogy, assume you are trying a new recipe for the first
time.  This time, you grocery shop after you had a snack, so you stick to your core grocery
list. Your expense is much lower this time around! Then, as you make the meal, you decide sweet
potatoes would go great as a side dish (or ice cream&mdash;your story, your choice). So,
you simply add this to your list. Although your price slightly increases, the additional
satisfaction you gain from this enhanced recipe justifies that increase. 

Just as with a CRM implementation, you will better understand where your investment creates
the most effective return after you have already tried it. Dynamics 365 Sales OnTrack is to
help you invest effectively and efficiently.
