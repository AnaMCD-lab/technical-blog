On April 12, AWS&reg; Premier Consulting Partner **CorpInfo** held a deep dive on Amazon Aurora&reg; event at *The Standard* in New York City. The agenda included a technical presentation from AWS Solutions Architect Puneet Agarwal, an Aurora case study featuring CorpInfo customer GoGuardian&reg;, and a discussion on how to make the business case for Aurora in your organization.

After the presentation, attendees enjoyed a cocktail hour and networking with their peers and AWS Reps. The event drew nearly 30 CTOs, SVPs, VPs, Presidents/Owners, IT Directors, and DBAs. Key takeaways from our conversations with event attendees were that Amazon Aurora is incredibly exciting and there is real interest around organizations using it to solve their database challenges, including the need for a fully managed database service that provides faster databases with more core CPU power, instance sizes, and throughput. 

### Deep dive on Amazon Aurora

AWS database migration service with its schema conversion tool to migrate intensive workloads is very attractive for companies looking to improve their operations by moving to the cloud. An added benefit of AWS database migration service is that the customer no longer has to provision storage. This service has quickly become one of the most effective AWS services available. CorpInfo has done a really good job compiling Amazon Aurora's highlights, and we have made those highlights available to you in the following document: [Amazon Aurora deep dive](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/corpinfowebsiteuploads/content/uploads/2016/04/14120846/Deep-Dive-on-Amazon-Aurora.pdf). 

Most relational databases were not designed for the cloud, having various layers of functionality in a monolithic stack. When organizations try to scale out these databases, they end up replicating the same stack resulting in problems such as availability, cost, and flexibility. Amazon Aurora can solve your database challenges. Aurora is Amazonâ€™s highly secure and fully managed MySQL-compatible relational database engine. The platform provides users with high performance (5x) at a fraction of the cost (1/10th) of a traditional MySQL database with the scalability and availability benefits of hosting in the AWS Cloud.

#### Why are organizations using Amazon Aurora?

+ Easy to use, and more efficient.
+ Highly available simplified storage management.
+ Predictable and faster failover with survivable caches and instant crash recovery.
+ Data security and monitoring capabilities.
+ Managed Service delivery.
+ Easy migration with no down-time.
+ Significant cost savings.
