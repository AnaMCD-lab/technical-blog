So, what do you need to do to take advantage of Salesforce&reg; after you make the purchase?

I shared this [post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-characteristics-successful-salesforce-process-first-rob-gilman/)
several years ago, and it's still relevant to any business approaching the implementation
of Salesforce. The phases include planning, customizing, deploying, user education, and
future management of this robust tool.

### 1. Plan and prepare

Before jumping into the process of implementing your Salesforce CRM, it's important to
create a plan identifying company vision, goals, and metrics, as well as resources, tools,
and dependencies. Organizing a team that includes a project sponsor, administrator, project
manager, users, and trainers is a good idea. It's also usually best to trust a certified
Salesforce implementation partner to help organize and lead the project. A good partner
focuses on your current business processes to ensure the solution is properly custom
engineered. They set goals, understand your data, select an implementation approach, and
build a project timeline.

### 2. Set up and customize

Salesforce allows for *click-not-code* built-in configuration tools, rather than using
Force.com code (Apex) to make things easy for the initial implementation. You can develop
and build on this over time. Don't wait to define how to customize the application. For
example, define security settings, customize the application with fields, layouts, objects,
tabs, and rules, and create your reports. Be careful not to over-configure, making things
more complicated than need be.

### 3. Deploy the Salesforce platform

The timeline defined in the planning stage should define the deployment phases and schedule.
Get your instance of Salesforce production-ready by creating and adding users, loading your
data, and training users. Be sure to communicate early and often, so users know about coming
changes. As deployment draws near, outline the deployment plan, including scheduled user
training and support plans and procedures.

### 4. User adoption

Now that you're up and running, it's useless without employee engagement. Be sure to support
users, measure adoption, and encourage adoption. The sponsor of the project should communicate
clear expectations and excitement. Establishing to the team that *if it isn't in Salesforce,
it doesn't exist* is a well-proven method. Ensure that employees keep up with necessary
training, and make it known that Salesforce tracks all tasks and performance.

### 5. Proper management and development going forward

After Salesforce is live, begin new planning for the next phases. You're going to need to
address new functionality, user requests, and on-going development. A certified Salesforce
partner can help with day-to-day administration and support, on-the-fly customizations,
integrations with other internal applications, and custom application development. This
can help with saving time and money on valuable internal resources and ensuring you are
getting the maximum out of the platform from a certified team of Salesforce experts
