### An IoT enabled solution

At a recent Onica Hack-a-thon we utilized Amazon Rekognition&reg; along with a stock Raspberry&reg; Pi 3 to customize a NERF&reg; Rapidstrike for a fun solution to an office problem: a busy CTO who is sometimes a little distracted.

### Fully automatic NERF Rapidstrike

Choosing the correct NERF Blaster for this project was important, we required that it be fully automatic in operation and electrical in actuation. We ultimately chose the NERF CS-18 N-Strike Elite Rapidstrike as it met our criteria and is mod-friendly. The blaster needed to still operate normally while not being controlled, needed to be powered even with batteries installed, and the ability to be *overpowered* to shoot faster and farther.

### The specifications

The controller perched atop the gun is the *brains* for our Tactical IoT NERF Rapidstrike, controlled by a stock Raspberry P1 3 and Amazon Rekognition. We chose the CPU for its ease of use and available software libraries, and then paired with an Adafruit&reg; 2.8‚Äù PiTFT display with Adafruit enclosure and Faceplate. The camera we used is the standard Pi (version 1.3) with an Adafruit Pi Camera Board Case.

### Target Lock with Amazon Reckognition

For our particular dilemma, we used Rekognition to add all team members to a *safe* list that will hold fire, while we added our CTO as the target, which means a barrage of foam projectiles once our IoT NERF Rapidstrike identifies him.
