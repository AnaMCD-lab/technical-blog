Let's take a look at Salesforce capabilities.

In a recent post on LinkedIn&reg;, I shared how Salesforce&reg; has become an
all-encompassing management cloud software solution. Here is a recap of that
post for businesses looking to maximize the value of their Salesforce platform.

`Salesforce.com` has long outgrown its origins as a simple CRM solution, though
it still maintains its position as a market leader in that respect. So what is
Salesforce today?

Beyond the additions of marketing automation tools and customer service cloud,
which have proven to greatly enhance customer relationship management,
Salesforce has expanded on product offerings to drive continued growth. The
additions of Chatter&reg;, the AppExchange&reg;, `force.com`, and VMforce&reg;
are all examples of capabilities that extend beyond a sales tool and have
revolutionized – maybe even redefined (SaaS) Software as a Service.

`force.com` created a programming platform with a full suite of tools for
administrators, developers, and business users. This has allowed app building
 that automates complex business processes faster and easier than ever
before. The AppExchange created a marketplace for developers to sell those
applications, which can be fitted to suit the needs of any business function or
process. Chatter on the other hand has broadened the impact of `salesforce.com`
by creating a social feature, making communication among departments and
organizations seamless and easy. VMforce takes things even further, offering the
Benioff coined term “platform as a service”, which allows developers to build
and deploy apps to any platform that supports Java&reg;.

Long story short, as a whole, Salesforce continues to build an all-encompassing
enterprise business management cloud software solution behind Marc Benioff’s
vision. From Sales, Marketing and, Service, to HR, IT, and Finance, Salesforce
can be molded and manipulated to do what you tell it to do. Or, tell your
implementation partner to do.
