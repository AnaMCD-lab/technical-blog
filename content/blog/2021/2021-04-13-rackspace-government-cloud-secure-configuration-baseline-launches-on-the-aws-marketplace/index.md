We designed the Rackspace Government Cloud Secure Configuration Baseline (RGCSCB) to
support government cloud workloads, delivered to the customer as an Amazon&reg; Machine
Image (AMI).

<!--more-->

Rackspace hardens the Red Hat Enterprise Linux&reg; (RHEL) and Microsoft&reg; Windows
Server&reg; operating systems to a *secure configuration baseline* and provides updated
AMIs and compliance scan results monthly.

### We comply with strict security guidelines

After spending over a decade in the Department of Defense, let’s just say that I’m
intimately familiar with secure operating systems. I was a user of them the entire time,
and I was actually responsible for their development and deployment for the entire agency
for around three years. So when it comes to building, maintaining, and deploying an
operating system baseline compliant with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)
Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG), I can confidently say that it can be a
pain in the you-know-what.

This fact makes me so excited that we can bring RGCSCB to market so that hopefully, lots
of people and organizations can avoid the frustration and irritation of trying to create a
STIG image that doesn’t break all the things they actually need to work while it does its
job. RGCSCB deploys with a high level of STIG compliance out of the box, making it the
perfect foundation on top of which to build your organization’s secure baseline.

Rackspace is a FedRAMP authorized CSP, and as a result, we are subject to strict compliance
guidelines when it comes to operating system security. Rackspace is responsible for securing,
creating, and providing the AMI, and a corresponding compliance report, in accordance with
the Secure Configuration Baseline. Rackspace plans to provide updated AMIs and reports every
month. At a minimum, the Secure Configuration Baseline implements a subset of the DISA STIG
benchmarks but might include additional modifications and Rackspace-defined controls. RGCSCB
provides you on-demand access to the same secure and compliant baseline we provide to our
managed security and compliance customers. You can purchase RGCSCB on-demand directly from
the AWS Marketplace for both Windows and RHEL.

Any controls in addition to, or instead of, STIG controls might, or might not, be acceptable
for use by government agencies. The customer’s responsibility is to ensure there is no
conflict of applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, or other
mandated compliance requirements. 

### Conclusion

Within the U.S., Rackspace Technology remains a leader in the FedRAMP authorization-enablement
space, powering 16 FedRAMP ATOs built on our managed service. We provide 24x7x365 hybrid-cloud
management, operational support, and security services as a packaged, on-demand, audited,
and pay-as-you-go service. Rackspace Technology also handles approximately 80% of the
operational and documentation burden of your environment’s security and compliance requirements
to help you receive a FedRAMP ATO.
